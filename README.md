## Inspiration
A more comprehensive, long-term version of other course planning technologies, it centralizes all aspects of semester and degree planning into one application. Instead of having to make excel spreadsheets or switch between tabs and try to cross-compare distribution, major, and pre-professional/grad school requirements, you can see them all in one place with OnCourse. OnCourse will let you track how far along you are with each set of requirements, and will recommend courses for you based on what fits in your existing schedule and which requirements you have not yet fulfilled. If applicable, it will also suggest courses based on efficiency towards your major, i.e. if a certain course fulfills multiple requirements (for example, a major requirement as well as a pre-med requirement). The main page only shows a schedule for a single semester, but it will also have a four-year planning feature without day or time specificity on the courses.

## What it does
We built our website using HTML, CSS, php, and MySQL through XAMPP. We divided the work into frontend, backend, and design, and worked in conversation with each other to create our website demo.

## How we built it
We ran into a lot of challenges due to the fact that we had never built a website before. When it came to formatting we had to do a lot of research and learn how to add elements that make the site not only user friendly, but also graphically pleasing.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We are proud of using our limited coding experience to create a website and build something even though we are beginner hackers with coding experience ranging from none at all, to CS111, to CS230.

## What we learned
We learned how to use CSS to style a website and how to use HTML to create the website. We also learned how to work in VSCode. We also learned how to code as a team, dividing work and ensuring that everyone had a task and was able to work without waiting on another team member.

## What’s next for OnCourse?
Future features that we hope to add in OnCourse are customizing the filter to include users with double majors/minors, the probability of getting a seat in a specific class, and generating a 4 year course plan based on major interests. We hope to continue working on this project on our own time and implementing the features that we believe makes OnCourse unique.
